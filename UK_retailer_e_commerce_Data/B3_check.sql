-- Identify which products are returned most often
-- This involves analyzing the frequency and volume of returns. You should:

-- Count how many times each product appears in return transactions.
-- Sum the total negative quantity per product to determine the total number of units returned.
-- Rank products by total return volume.
-- Insight: Helps identify problematic products that may have quality issues, incorrect descriptions, or other reasons for dissatisfaction.






-- Track return rates by product, category, or time period
-- To understand return patterns, we need to:

-- Group return data by product category (if available).
-- Aggregate returns over time (daily, weekly, or monthly) to detect patterns.
-- Calculate the return rate for each product or category.
-- ðŸ’¡ Formula for Return Rate:

-- ReturnÂ Rate
-- =
-- TotalÂ ReturnsÂ (NegativeÂ QuantityÂ *Â UnitPrice)
-- GrossÂ Sales
-- ReturnÂ Rate= 
-- GrossÂ Sales
-- TotalÂ ReturnsÂ (NegativeÂ QuantityÂ *Â UnitPrice)
-- â€‹

-- Insight:

-- Helps pinpoint if certain categories (e.g., apparel vs. electronics) have higher return rates.
-- Detects seasonal return trends (e.g., after holiday shopping).
