here is the key objectives of my entire project

A: overview/dashboard summary

B: sales analytics
   B1: revenue and sales trends overtime
         - Analyze sales performance by day, week, month, quarter, or year.
         - Identify peak sales periods (e.g., holiday spikes, seasonal trends).
         - Detect slumps in sales and investigate possible reasons (e.g., market conditions, stock shortages). 
   B2: order volume and frequency analysis 
         - Understand how often orders occur and the average size of an order.
         - Detect low vs. high purchase frequency periods.
customer analytics 
         - Investigate high-volume purchasing trends (bulk purchases, repeat customers)
   B3: refund and return analysis
        - Identify which products are returned most often.
        - Track return rates by product, category, or time period.
        - Investigate reasons for high return rates (product issues, sizing problems, etc.).
               *. Optional Enhancements
                Time-Based Return Analysis: Add a date column to the analysis to track return rates over time (e.g., by month).

                Add Total Counts: Add columns like Total Units Returned and Total Units Sold to help contextualize return rates.

                Top Return Categories/Products: Show top 5â€“10 products/categories by return rate, or flag those exceeding a threshold (e.g., >10%).
   B4: Impact of Discounts & Promotions
        - Track sales with vs. without discounts
        - Understand how discounts impact revenue and profit margins
        - Evaluate if promotions increase sales volume or just lower margins.

C: customer analytics 

D: product analytics

E: traffic and marketing analytics

F: financial performance

I would like to show you what ive come up with for that B3 part 2

1: I grouped the product by category to see the sum of quantity per category

# Group by Product Category (assuming 'Category' column is available)
return_data = df_main[df_main['Quantity'] < 0]  # Only negative quantity for returns
category_return = return_data.groupby('Category')['Quantity'].sum().reset_index()
category_return = category_return.sort_values(by='Quantity', ascending=False)  # Sort by total return volume
category_return

2: I made Product-Level Return Rate Calculation

# Grouping by product and calculating the total quantity sold for each product
total_sales = df_main.groupby('Description')['Quantity'].sum().reset_index()  # Total sales by product

# Ensure only positive quantities (sales) are included in total sales
total_sales = total_sales[total_sales['Quantity'] > 0]

# Merging the return data with the total sales data
merged_data = return_data.merge(total_sales, on='Description', suffixes=('_returned', '_sold'))

# Calculate the return rate for each product
merged_data['Return Rate'] = merged_data['Quantity_returned'] / merged_data['Quantity_sold'] * 100

# Group by product and calculate the average return rate
return_rate_by_product = merged_data.groupby('Description')['Return Rate'].mean().reset_index()

# Now, return_rate_by_product is a DataFrame with 'Description' and 'Return Rate' as separate columns
print(return_rate_by_product)

3: i made Category-Level Return Rate Calculation

# Grouping by category and calculating the total quantity sold for each category
total_sales_category = df_main.groupby('Category')['Quantity'].sum().reset_index()  # Total sales by category

# Ensure only positive quantities (sales) are included in total sales
total_sales_category = total_sales_category[total_sales_category['Quantity'] > 0]

# Merging the return data with the total sales data
return_data_category = return_data.merge(total_sales_category, on='Category', suffixes=('_returned', '_sold'))

# Calculate the return rate for each category
return_data_category['Return Rate'] = return_data_category['Quantity_returned'] / return_data_category['Quantity_sold'] * 100

# Group by category and calculate the average return rate
return_rate_by_category = return_data_category.groupby('Category')['Return Rate'].mean().reset_index()

print(return_rate_by_category)
