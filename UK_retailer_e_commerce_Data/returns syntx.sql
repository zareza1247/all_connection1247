GROUP BY StockCode, Description
ORDER BY Return_Count DESC;  -- Ranking products by most frequently returned

-- SUM(ABS(Quantity)) AS Total_Units_Returned:
-- The ABS(Quantity) function is used to ignore the sign of the quantity, ensuring you are summing the absolute value of the quantities (which will be positive). Since returns are represented as negative quantities, this will give you the total units returned.

-- Return_Count: Youâ€™ll get the number of times a product has been returned, helping you identify the most frequently returned items.
-- Total_Units_Returned: Youâ€™ll also know how many units of each product have been returned in total.
-- Ordering by Return Count: The ORDER BY clause sorts the results by how frequently each product is returned, from most to least, helping you prioritize which products might need further investigation due to high return rates.

-- Track return rates by product, category, or time period
-- 		To understand return patterns, we need to:
-- 			â€¢ Group return data by product category (if available).
-- 			â€¢ Aggregate returns over time (daily, weekly, or monthly) to detect patterns.
-- 			â€¢ Calculate the return rate for each product or category.
-- 		ðŸ’¡ Formula for Return Rate:
-- 		Return Rate=Total Returns (Negative Quantity * UnitPrice)Gross Sales\text{Return Rate} = \frac{\text{Total Returns (Negative Quantity * UnitPrice)}}{\text{Gross Sales}}Return Rate=Gross SalesTotal Returns (Negative Quantity * UnitPrice)â€‹
-- 		Insight:
-- 			â€¢ Helps pinpoint if certain categories (e.g., apparel vs. electronics) have higher return rates.
-- 			â€¢ Detects seasonal return trends (e.g., after holiday shopping).
